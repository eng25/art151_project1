Visual Simplicity
I want this piece to have only a few elements, so that the user would be forced to focus on the central point of the piece, that is the pixies.
To achieve this, rather than have a complicated background, I chose a simple white circle on black background, so that the only color on the page was the pixies.

Organic Randomness
I wanted movement from the pixies that appeared organic.
To achieve this, I employed the use of Perlin Noise and Vectors which I believe gives each of the pixes a flutter effect.
