Visual Simplicity
I want this piece to have only a few elements, so that the user would be forced to focus on the central point of the piece, that is the pixies.
To achieve this, rather than have a complicated background, I chose a simple white circle on black background, so that the only color on the page was the pixies.

Control of Focus
I want this piece to be able to capture the focus of people viewing and direct it at specific elements of the piece, in a natural non intrusive way.
To achieve this, I used specific color choices, specific use of movement, as well as a random glow effect to make pixies stand out more.

Organic Randomness
I wanted movement from the pixies that appeared organic.
To achieve this, I employed the use of Perlin Noise and Vectors which I believe gives each of the pixies a flutter effect.

Directions
Move mouse over pixies to slow them down
Click outside the circle to add more pixies
